## **Motivation**  

The motivation behind this project comes from the consistent political discourse around abortion laws. Abortion laws in the United States has a long history of being politicized, often being brought up as a leading point in Women's Rights advocacy. When Roe v Wade, one of the most important and groundbreaking pieces of legislation to ever be enacted regarding abortion, was overturned in June 2022 this created an uproar. We started to see abortion facilities decreasing in Red states and stricter laws being enforced. With both midterm elections and the new major threat to reproductive rights happening in 2022, our group found this to be a timely and pressing public health issue to address. 

## **Initial Questions** 

From the available data we are interested in answering the following questions: 

1. Regarding abortion laws and accessibility
    -  Since the overturn of Roe v Wade how has accessibility to          abortion clinics changed between June 2022 and July 2022?  
    - How do abortion laws and restrictions differ among each state?  
2. Regarding voter eligibility and turnout 
    - How has the voting eligibility population changed from 2018 to        2022? 
    - Was there any change in voter turnout rate from 2018 to 2022?
    
3. Regarding the relationship between abortion laws and voter         turnout
    - What, if any, influence has abortion laws in 2022 had on            change in voter turnout from 2018 to 2022? 
    - What, if any, influence has abortion provider accessibility         had on voter turnout rates from 2018 to 2022?


## **Data Processing and Cleaning**

### **Cleaning the data sets** 

### Abortion Clinic Distances By County and State: [dataset](https://osf.io/pfxq3/)
The dataset from Myers Abortion Facility Database was downloaded and read in.  The dataset was filtered to only include distances from June 2022 and July 2022 to reflect the immediate change in average distance to abortion provider immediately before and after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  Variables of interest, such as county, state, year, month, and distance to closest abortion clinic, were kept.  After converting numerical months to abbrevations, the dataset was pivoted to a wide format to create a variable for each months' distance.  The `dist_change` variable  was created taking the difference in average distance per county for the two months.

After selecting variables for analysis and pivoting to wide format, the mean distance for each state was taken by averaging all counties by month and change in average distance.  These means were then merged by state to create one finalized distance dataset.
```{r, message = FALSE}
clinicdist =
  read_csv("datasets/2022.10.01_abortionaccess_countyxmonth.csv")

countydist_change = 
  subset(clinicdist, year == 2022 & (month == 6 | month == 7)) %>%
  select(origin_county_name, origin_state, year, month, distance_origintodest) %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month]
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "month", 
    values_from = "distance_origintodest") %>%
  mutate(
     dist_change = Jul - Jun
  )

statedist_change = 
  aggregate(dist_change ~ origin_state, countydist_change, mean)

statedist_Jun =
  aggregate(Jun ~ origin_state, countydist_change, mean)

statedist_Jul =
  aggregate(Jul ~ origin_state, countydist_change, mean)

statedist = 
  merge(statedist_Jun, statedist_Jul, by = c("origin_state")) %>%
  merge(statedist_change, by = c("origin_state"))

write.csv(statedist,"data_cleaned/statedist_final.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

  

### Abortion Laws By State: [dataset](https://lawatlas.org/datasets/abortion-bans)

*Abortion restrictions data* 

First, we read in the data on abortion laws restriction status by state 2018 found [here](https://lawatlas.org/datasets/abortion-bans). The `bans2018` data set is then cleaned and tidied to prepare for merging with other data sets. Note that states that had no abortion restrictions in 2018 were intentionally coded as `.` by the original coder. These were replaced with `0` to reflect their status for further data analysis. A `year` and `state_abv` variables were created, and Washington DC was renamed to District of Columbia. Next, we read in the 2022 data on abortion restrictions by state found [here](https://ballotpedia.org/Abortion_regulations_by_state). Though this data set was not available to download, we were able to scrape it from the source webpage. A `year` and `state_abv` variables were added to the `bans2022` data set, and `Washington DC` was renamed `District of Columbia` to match the 2018 data set. 


```{r}
bans2018 <-
  read_excel("datasets/abortion_bans_data_Oct 2021.xlsx", sheet = "Statistical Data", range = "A1:H127") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(
    state = jurisdiction,
    abstatus = prohibit_req) %>% 
  mutate(
    state_abv = state.abb[match(state, state.name)],
    state_abv = ifelse(is.na(state_abv), "DC", state_abv),
    year = lubridate::year(effective_date),
    abstatus = replace(abstatus, abstatus == ".", "0")) %>% 
    select(state, state_abv, year, abstatus) %>% 
  filter(year == 2018)

bans_link <- "https://ballotpedia.org/Abortion_regulations_by_state"
bans_page <- read_html(bans_link)

bans2022 <- 
  bans_page %>%  html_nodes("table") %>% .[2] %>% 
  html_table() %>% .[[1]] %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(
    state = state_abortion_restrictions_based_on_stage_of_pregnancy,
    abstatus = state_abortion_restrictions_based_on_stage_of_pregnancy_2,
    threshold = state_abortion_restrictions_based_on_stage_of_pregnancy_3) %>% 
  mutate(
  state = replace(state, state == "Washington, D.C.", "District of Columbia"),
  state_abv = state.abb[match(state, state.name)],
  state_abv = ifelse(is.na(state_abv), "DC", state_abv),
  year = 2022,
  abstatus = recode(abstatus, "Yes" = "1", "No" = "0")) %>% 
  select(- threshold) %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  head(51) %>% 
  arrange(state) 
```

Finally, we merge 2018-2021 and 2022 data sets together. The resulting data set is saved as a CSV file to merge with data sets on voter turnout and clinic abortion distances. The new data set include 4 variables, some of which are listed below:

* `state`: State name
* `abstatus18`: Abortion restriction status in 2018 ( 1 = restricted, 0 = not restricted)
* `abstatus22`: Abortion restriction status in 2022 ( 1 = restricted, 0 = not restricted)


```{r}
abortion_bans <-
  full_join(bans2018, bans2022) %>% 
  arrange(state, year) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = abstatus) %>% 
  rename(abstatus18 = '2018', abstatus22 = '2022') 

  write_csv(abortion_bans, "data_cleaned/abortion_bans_final.csv")
```



### Voter Turnout By State:  [dataset](https://www.electproject.org/2022g)

The 2022 Voter Turnout dataset was pulled from [US Elections Project](https://www.electproject.org/2022g). The data was downloaded as an xlsx file and read into R with a range restriction because the dataset had notes clarifying the data that were not useful to import into R. The names of variables of interest were renamed to `State`, `turnout_estimate2022`, `turnoutrate2022`, `voting_eligible_pop2022`, and `voting_age_pop2022` to clarify what they were representing. Those four variables plus `state_abv` was selected out of the dataset. The other variables in the dataset involved data on the percent of people who were eligible to vote based on age, but were ineligible because of other factors which were not of interest to us so they were not kept in our final dataset.   

The 2022 Voter Turnout dataset was pulled from [US Elections Project](https://www.electproject.org/2018g). This dataset was similar to the 2022 Vote Turnout dataset so an identical cleaning process was conducted. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
  read_xlsx("datasets/2022 November General Election.xlsx", sheet = "Turnout Rates", range = "A2:N54") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = x1, turnout_estimate2022 = preliminary_total_turnout_estimate, turnoutRate2022 = preliminary_turnout_rate, voting_eligible_pop2022 = voting_eligible_population_vep, voting_age_pop2022 = voting_age_population_vap) %>% 
  select(state, turnout_estimate2022, turnoutRate2022, voting_eligible_pop2022, voting_age_pop2022, state_abv)

voting2022_df =
  read_xlsx("datasets/2022 November General Election.xlsx", sheet = "Turnout Rates", range = "A2:N54") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = x1, turnout_estimate2022 = preliminary_total_turnout_estimate, turnoutRate2022 = preliminary_turnout_rate, voting_eligible_pop2022 = voting_eligible_population_vep, voting_age_pop2022 = voting_age_population_vap) %>% 
  select(state, turnout_estimate2022, turnoutRate2022, voting_eligible_pop2022, voting_age_pop2022, state_abv)

voting2018_df = 
    read_xlsx("datasets/2018 November General Election.xlsx", sheet = "Turnout Rates", range = "A2:P54") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  
  rename(state = x1, turnout_estimate2018 = estimated_or_actual_2018_total_ballots_counted, turnoutRate2018 = estimated_or_actual_2018_total_ballots_counted_vep_turnout_rate, voting_eligible_pop2018 = voting_eligible_population_vep, voting_age_pop2018 = voting_age_population_vap) %>% 
  select(state, turnout_estimate2018, turnoutRate2018, voting_eligible_pop2018, voting_age_pop2018, state_abv)

```

The two datasets were then merged by the `state_abv` variable. New variables were created that were the difference in values between 2022 and 2018 so that we could see how values changed between the two elections. These variables are `turnout_estimate_difference`, `turnout_Rate_difference`, `voting_eligible_difference`, and `voting_age_difference`. In the merge, there ended up being two State variables: `state.x` and `state.y`. One of the variables were removed and the other one was renamed to `state`. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
voting_df = 
  full_join(voting2022_df, voting2018_df, by = "state_abv") %>% 
  select(-state.x) %>% 
  mutate(turnout_estimate_difference = turnout_estimate2022 - turnout_estimate2018, turnout_Rate_difference = turnoutRate2022 - turnoutRate2018, voting_eligible_difference = voting_eligible_pop2022 - voting_eligible_pop2018, voting_age_difference = voting_age_pop2022 - voting_age_pop2018) %>% 
  rename(state = state.y)

voting_df <- voting_df[, c(6, 5, 1, 7, 11, 2, 8, 12, 3, 9, 13, 4, 10, 14)]

write.csv(voting_df,"data_cleaned/Voting Turnout - Final.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


### **Merging the Three Datasets** 

The final three datasets were merged into one large datasets to prepare it for analysis. The Abortion Bans dataset was imported into R from the .csv file. The Voting Turnout datastet was imported into R from the .csv file and the United States row was removed because none of the other datasets had an equivalent row. The Distance to an Abortion Clinic dataset was imported and the `origin_state` variable was renamed to `state_abv` to match the other two datasets since this was the variable that would be used to join the three datasets. 

The Abortion Bans and Voting Turnout datasets were merged first by the `state_abv` variable that existed in both datasets. In the merge, there ended up being two State variables: `state.x` and `state.y`. One of the variables were removed and the other one was renamed to `state`. This combined dataset was then combined with the Distance to an Aborion Clinic dataset by the `state_abv` variable that existed in both datasets. The `jun` variable was renamed to `clinicdistance_jun` and the `jul` variable was renamed to `clinicdistance_jul` to clarify what these variables were. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
abortionbans_df = 
  read.csv("data_cleaned/abortion_bans_final.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

votingturnout_df = 
  read.csv("data_cleaned/Voting Turnout - Final.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!row_number() %in% c(1))

statedist_df = 
  read.csv("data_cleaned/statedist_final.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state_abv = origin_state)


abortionvoting_df =
  full_join(abortionbans_df, votingturnout_df, by = "state_abv") %>% 
  select(-state.y) %>% 
  rename(state = state.x)

abortionvoting_df =
  full_join(abortionvoting_df, statedist_df, by = "state_abv") %>% 
  rename(clinicdistance_jun = jun, clinicdistance_jul = jul)
  
write.csv(abortionvoting_df,"data_cleaned/finalprojectfinaldataset.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### Regression Analysis 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

A variable, `ab_change` was created to quantify the change in abortion restriction status per state (`ab_change` = 1 if Roe v. Wade added an abortion restriction that was not previously in place; `ab_change` = 0 if the overturning of Roe v. Wade did not change abortion restrictions).  This variable was created by taking the difference between abortion restriction status in 2022 and 2018.


```{r clean}
final_full = 
  read_csv("data_cleaned/finalprojectfinaldataset.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    ab_change = abstatus22 - abstatus18
  )
```

A regression model was created utilizing the following:

* Outcome: The difference in percent turnout rate between 2018 and 2022 (`turnout_rate_difference`)
* Predictor: The difference in abortion restriction status by state between 2018 and 2022 (`ab_change`)
* Predictor: The average difference in closest abortion clinic by state between 2018 and 2022 (`dist_change`)

```{r full_regress}
regress_turnoutdif_full = 
  lm(turnout_rate_difference ~ ab_change + dist_change, data = final_full)

summary(regress_turnoutdif_full) 
confint(regress_turnoutdif_full)
```

Upon running the model, we find that the change in abortion status has a significant effect on voter turnout (P = 0.0261).  On average, a state that had an abortion restriction put in place after the overturning of Roe v. Wade had a 5.661% greater voter turnout in the 2022 election compared to the 2018 election.  We are 95% confident that the true increase in voter turnout falls between 0.703% and 10.619%.

The average change in distance to abortion clinic was not significant.

## **Discussion**

The first set of questions we were interested in answering focused on abortion laws and accessibility. Unfortunately, as expected, we did see an increase in the average distance to a safe abortion provider in states such as Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma. These are states that have already had strict laws regarding abortion prior to the overturn of Roe v. Wade. With the overturn, accessibility to safe abortions has only become more inaccessible especially in Texas. In figure 5 we can see that the average distance to an Abortion Clinic dramatically increases from an average of ~140 miles to ~ 300 miles. 

When assessing the voter turnout data, it was surprising to see that in most states, voter turnout was either the same in 2018 and 2022 or there was a lower voter turnout in 2022. This was interesting to note as the eligible population (figure 3) stayed the same in most states, with 2022 actually having a higher eligible population in 2022. 

When looking at the relationship between abortion laws and abortion clinic accessibility and voter turnout, we see that change in abortion restrictions from 2018 to 2022 had a significant impact on voter turnout from the 2018 to 2022 election. Further research may find other datasets which take into account other confounding variables which may also have increased voter turnout. From these analyses we can come to a reasonable conclusion that the overturn of Roe v Wade had some influence on voter turnout in the midterm elections of 2022. 

## Limitations 

The abortion laws datasets had a lot of missing data for the years 2019-2021. So our anlaysis is limited to the years 2018 and 2022. This was not a major issue since we used voter turnout data on the same years for different reasons.Additionally, we decided not to use the data on threshold for abortion restrictions in our statistical analysis due to time restrictions and coding challenges though we used it to show spatial distribution of such thresholds. 

Some states had not fully finished counting their votes by the time the 2022 voting data was compiled so these are preliminary numbers though they were close to full count. Based on that we don't expect a major change in our finding using the complete count data for the analysis. 

Our analysis did not examine data on issues that may confound the association between overturn of  Roe v Wade and voter turnout in the 2022 eections.
