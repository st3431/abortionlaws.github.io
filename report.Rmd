## Motivation  

The motivation behind this project comes from the consistent political discourse around abortion laws. Abortion laws in the United States has a long history of being politicized, often being brought up as a leading point in Women's Rights advocacy. When Roe v Wade, one of the most important and groundbreaking pieces of legislation to ever be enacted regarding abortion, was overturned in June 2022 this created an uproar. We started to see abortion facilities decreasing in Red states and stricter laws being enforced. With both midterm elections and the new major threat to reproductive rights happening in 2022, our group found this to be a timely and pressing public health issue to address.
