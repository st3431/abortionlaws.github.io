## **Motivation**  

The motivation behind this project comes from the consistent political discourse around abortion laws. Abortion laws in the United States has a long history of being politicized, often being brought up as a leading point in Women's Rights advocacy. When Roe v Wade, one of the most important and groundbreaking pieces of legislation to ever be enacted regarding abortion, was overturned in June 2022 this created an uproar. We started to see abortion facilities decreasing in Red states and stricter laws being enforced. With both midterm elections and the new major threat to reproductive rights happening in 2022, our group found this to be a timely and pressing public health issue to address. 

## **Initial Questions** 

Based on the available data we were interested in answering the following questions: 

- How has voter turnout and eligibility changed by state between 2018 and 2022? 
- Since the overturn of Roe v Wade how has accessibility to abortion clinics changed between June 2022 and July 2022? 
- How do abortion laws and restrictions differ among each state? 

## **Data Processing and Cleaning**

### **Cleaning the data sets** 

### Abortion Clinic Distances By County and State: [dataset](https://osf.io/pfxq3/)

```{r, message = FALSE}
clinicdist =
  read_csv("datasets/2022.10.01_abortionaccess_countyxmonth.csv")

countydist_change = 
  subset(clinicdist, year == 2022 & (month == 6 | month == 7)) %>%
  select(origin_county_name, origin_state, year, month, distance_origintodest) %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month]
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "month", 
    values_from = "distance_origintodest") %>%
  mutate(
     dist_change = Jul - Jun
  )

statedist_change = 
  aggregate(dist_change ~ origin_state, countydist_change, mean)

statedist_Jun =
  aggregate(Jun ~ origin_state, countydist_change, mean)

statedist_Jul =
  aggregate(Jul ~ origin_state, countydist_change, mean)

statedist = 
  merge(statedist_Jun, statedist_Jul, by = c("origin_state")) %>%
  merge(statedist_change, by = c("origin_state"))

write.csv(statedist,"data_cleaned/statedist_final.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

  

### Abortion Laws By State: [dataset](https://lawatlas.org/datasets/abortion-bans)

*Abortion restrictions data* 

First, we read in the data on abortion laws restriction status by state 2018 found [here](https://lawatlas.org/datasets/abortion-bans). The `bans2018` data set is then cleaned and tidied to prepare for merging with other data sets. Note that states that had no abortion restrictions in 2018 were intentionally coded as `.` by the original coder. These were replaced with `0` to reflect their status for further data analysis. A `year` and `state_abv` variables were created, and Washington DC was renamed to District of Columbia. Next, we read in the 2022 data on abortion restrictions by state found [here](https://ballotpedia.org/Abortion_regulations_by_state). Though this data set was not available to download, we were able to scrape it from the source webpage. A `year` and `state_abv` variables were added to the `bans2022` data set, and `Washington DC` was renamed `District of Columbia` to match the 2018 data set. 


```{r}
bans2018 <-
  read_excel("datasets/abortion_bans_data_Oct 2021.xlsx", sheet = "Statistical Data", range = "A1:H127") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(
    state = jurisdiction,
    abstatus = prohibit_req) %>% 
  mutate(
    state_abv = state.abb[match(state, state.name)],
    state_abv = ifelse(is.na(state_abv), "DC", state_abv),
    year = lubridate::year(effective_date),
    abstatus = replace(abstatus, abstatus == ".", "0")) %>% 
    select(state, state_abv, year, abstatus) %>% 
  filter(year == 2018)

bans_link <- "https://ballotpedia.org/Abortion_regulations_by_state"
bans_page <- read_html(bans_link)

bans2022 <- 
  bans_page %>%  html_nodes("table") %>% .[2] %>% 
  html_table() %>% .[[1]] %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(
    state = state_abortion_restrictions_based_on_stage_of_pregnancy,
    abstatus = state_abortion_restrictions_based_on_stage_of_pregnancy_2,
    threshold = state_abortion_restrictions_based_on_stage_of_pregnancy_3) %>% 
  mutate(
  state = replace(state, state == "Washington, D.C.", "District of Columbia"),
  state_abv = state.abb[match(state, state.name)],
  state_abv = ifelse(is.na(state_abv), "DC", state_abv),
  year = 2022,
  abstatus = recode(abstatus, "Yes" = "1", "No" = "0")) %>% 
  select(- threshold) %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  head(51) %>% 
  arrange(state) 
```

Finally, we merge 2018-2021 and 2022 data sets together. The resulting data set is saved as a CSV file to merge with data sets on voter turnout and clinic abortion distances. The new data set include 4 variables, some of which are listed below:

* `state`: State name
* `abstatus18`: Abortion restriction status in 2018 ( 1 = restricted, 0 = not restricted)
* `abstatus22`: Abortion restriction status in 2022 ( 1 = restricted, 0 = not restricted)


```{r}
abortion_bans <-
  full_join(bans2018, bans2022) %>% 
  arrange(state, year) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = abstatus) %>% 
  rename(abstatus18 = '2018', abstatus22 = '2022') 

  write_csv(abortion_bans, "data_cleaned/abortion_bans_final.csv")
```



### Voter Turnout By State:  [dataset](https://www.electproject.org/2022g)

The 2022 Voter Turnout dataset was pulled from [US Elections Project](https://www.electproject.org/2022g). The data was downloaded as an xlsx file and read into R with a range restriction because the dataset had notes clarifying the data that were not useful to import into R. The names of variables of interest were renamed to `State`, `turnout_estimate2022`, `turnoutrate2022`, `voting_eligible_pop2022`, and `voting_age_pop2022` because the original names in the dataset had been confusing. Those four variables plus `state_abv` was selected out of the dataset. The other variables in the dataset involved data on the percent of people who were eligible to vote based on age, but were ineligible because of other factors which were not of interest to us so they were not kept in our final dataset.   

The 2022 Voter Turnout dataset was pulled from [US Elections Project](https://www.electproject.org/2018g). This dataset was similar to the 2022 Vote Turnout dataset so an identical cleaning process was conducted. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
  read_xlsx("datasets/2022 November General Election.xlsx", sheet = "Turnout Rates", range = "A2:N54") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = x1, turnout_estimate2022 = preliminary_total_turnout_estimate, turnoutRate2022 = preliminary_turnout_rate, voting_eligible_pop2022 = voting_eligible_population_vep, voting_age_pop2022 = voting_age_population_vap) %>% 
  select(state, turnout_estimate2022, turnoutRate2022, voting_eligible_pop2022, voting_age_pop2022, state_abv)

voting2022_df =
  read_xlsx("datasets/2022 November General Election.xlsx", sheet = "Turnout Rates", range = "A2:N54") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = x1, turnout_estimate2022 = preliminary_total_turnout_estimate, turnoutRate2022 = preliminary_turnout_rate, voting_eligible_pop2022 = voting_eligible_population_vep, voting_age_pop2022 = voting_age_population_vap) %>% 
  select(state, turnout_estimate2022, turnoutRate2022, voting_eligible_pop2022, voting_age_pop2022, state_abv)

voting2018_df = 
    read_xlsx("datasets/2018 November General Election.xlsx", sheet = "Turnout Rates", range = "A2:P54") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  
  rename(state = x1, turnout_estimate2018 = estimated_or_actual_2018_total_ballots_counted, turnoutRate2018 = estimated_or_actual_2018_total_ballots_counted_vep_turnout_rate, voting_eligible_pop2018 = voting_eligible_population_vep, voting_age_pop2018 = voting_age_population_vap) %>% 
  select(state, turnout_estimate2018, turnoutRate2018, voting_eligible_pop2018, voting_age_pop2018, state_abv)

```

The two datasets were then merged by the `state_abv` variable. New variables were created that were the difference in values between 2022 and 2018 so that we could see how values changed between the two elections. These variables are `turnout_estimate_difference`, `turnout_Rate_difference`, `voting_eligible_difference`, and `voting_age_difference`. In the merge, there ended up being two State variables: `state.x` and `state.y`. One of the variables were removed and the other one was renamed to `state`. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
voting_df = 
  full_join(voting2022_df, voting2018_df, by = "state_abv") %>% 
  select(-state.x) %>% 
  mutate(turnout_estimate_difference = turnout_estimate2022 - turnout_estimate2018, turnout_Rate_difference = turnoutRate2022 - turnoutRate2018, voting_eligible_difference = voting_eligible_pop2022 - voting_eligible_pop2018, voting_age_difference = voting_age_pop2022 - voting_age_pop2018) %>% 
  rename(state = state.y)

voting_df <- voting_df[, c(6, 5, 1, 7, 11, 2, 8, 12, 3, 9, 13, 4, 10, 14)]

write.csv(voting_df,"data_cleaned/Voting Turnout - Final.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


### **Merging the Three Datasets** 

The final three datasets were merged into one large datasets to prepare it for analysis. The Abortion Bans dataset was imported into R from the .csv file. The Voting Turnout datastet was imported into R from the .csv file and the United States row was removed because none of the other datasets had an equivalent row. The Distance to an Abortion Clinic dataset was imported and the `origin_state` variable was renamed to `state_abv` to match the other two datasets since this was the variable that would be used to join the three datasets. 

The Abortion Bans and Voting Turnout datasets were merged first by the `state_abv` variable that existed in both datasets. In the merge, there ended up being two State variables: `state.x` and `state.y`. One of the variables were removed and the other one was renamed to `state`. This combined dataset was then combined with the Distance to an Aborion Clinic dataset by the `state_abv` variable that existed in both datasets. The `jun` variable was renamed to `clinicdistance_jun` and the `jul` variable was renamed to `clinicdistance_jul` to clarify what these variables were. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
abortionbans_df = 
  read.csv("data_cleaned/abortion_bans_final.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

votingturnout_df = 
  read.csv("data_cleaned/Voting Turnout - Final.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!row_number() %in% c(1))

statedist_df = 
  read.csv("data_cleaned/statedist_final.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state_abv = origin_state)


abortionvoting_df =
  full_join(abortionbans_df, votingturnout_df, by = "state_abv") %>% 
  select(-state.y) %>% 
  rename(state = state.x)

abortionvoting_df =
  full_join(abortionvoting_df, statedist_df, by = "state_abv") %>% 
  rename(clinicdistance_jun = jun, clinicdistance_jul = jul)
  
write.csv(abortionvoting_df,"data_cleaned/finalprojectfinaldataset.csv", row.names = FALSE)
