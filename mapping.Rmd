## Motivation  

The motivation behind this project comes from the consistent political discourse around abortion laws. Abortion laws in the United States has a long history of being politicized, often being brought up as a leading point in Women's Rights advocacy. When Roe v Wade, one of the most important and groundbreaking laws to ever be enacted regarding abortion, was overturned this created an uproar.
