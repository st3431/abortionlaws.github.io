<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
<p>The motivation behind this project comes from the consistent
political discourse around abortion laws. Abortion laws in the United
States has a long history of being politicized, often being brought up
as a leading point in Women’s Rights advocacy. When Roe v Wade, one of
the most important and groundbreaking pieces of legislation to ever be
enacted regarding abortion, was overturned in June 2022 this created an
uproar. We started to see abortion facilities decreasing in Red states
and stricter laws being enforced. With both midterm elections and the
new major threat to reproductive rights happening in 2022, our group
found this to be a timely and pressing public health issue to
address.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Initial Questions</strong></h2>
<p>From the available data we are interested in answering the following
questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Regarding abortion laws and accessibility
<ul>
<li>Since the overturn of Roe v Wade how has accessibility to abortion
clinics changed between June 2022 and July 2022?<br />
</li>
<li>How do abortion laws and restrictions differ among each state?<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regarding voter eligibility and turnout
<ul>
<li>How has the voting eligibility population changed from 2018 to
2022?</li>
<li>Was there any change in voter turnout rate from 2018 to 2022?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regarding the relationship between abortion laws and voter turnout
<ul>
<li>What, if any, influence has abortion laws in 2022 had on change in
voter turnout from 2018 to 2022?</li>
<li>What, if any, influence has abortion provider accessibility had on
voter turnout rates from 2018 to 2022?</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>Abortion Clinic Distances By County and State: <a
href="https://osf.io/pfxq3/">dataset</a></h3>
<p>The dataset from Myers Abortion Facility Database was downloaded and
read in. The dataset was filtered to only include distances from June
2022 and July 2022 to reflect the immediate change in average distance
to abortion provider immediately before and after the overturning of Roe
v. Wade. Variables of interest, such as county, state, year, month, and
distance to closest abortion clinic, were kept. After converting
numerical months to abbreviations, the dataset was pivoted to a wide
format to create a variable for each months’ distance. The
<code>dist_change</code> variable was created taking the difference in
average distance per county for the two months.</p>
<p>After selecting variables for analysis and pivoting to wide format,
the mean distance for each state was taken by averaging all counties by
month and change in average distance. These means were then merged by
state to create one finalized distance dataset.</p>

<p>First, we read in the data on abortion laws restriction status by
state 2018 found <a

<code>bans2018</code> dataset is then cleaned and tidied to prepare for
merging with other datasets. Note that states that had no abortion
restrictions in 2018 were intentionally coded as <code>.</code> by the
original coder. These were replaced with <code>0</code> to reflect their
status for further data analysis. A <code>year</code> and
<code>state_abv</code> variables were created, and Washington DC was
renamed to District of Columbia. Next, we read in the 2022 data on
abortion restrictions by state found <a
href="https://ballotpedia.org/Abortion_regulations_by_state">here</a>.
Though this dataset was not available to download, we were able to
scrape it from the source webpage. A <code>year</code> and
<code>state_abv</code> variables were added to the <code>bans2022</code>
data set, and <code>Washington DC</code> was renamed
<code>District of Columbia</code> to match the 2018 dataset.</p>

<h3>Voter Turnout By State: <a
href="https://www.electproject.org/2022g">dataset</a></h3>
<p>The 2022 Voter Turnout dataset was pulled from <a
href="https://www.electproject.org/2022g">US Elections Project</a>. The
data was downloaded as an xlsx file and read into R with a range
restriction because the dataset had notes clarifying the data that were
not useful to import into R. The names of variables of interest were
renamed to <code>State</code>, <code>turnout_estimate2022</code>,
<code>turnoutrate2022</code>, <code>voting_eligible_pop2022</code>, and
<code>voting_age_pop2022</code> to clarify what they were representing.
Those four variables plus <code>state_abv</code> was selected out of the
dataset. The other variables in the dataset involved data on the percent
of people who were eligible to vote based on age, but were ineligible
because of other factors which were not of interest to us so they were
not kept in our final dataset.</p>
<p>The 2022 Voter Turnout dataset was pulled from <a
href="https://www.electproject.org/2018g">US Elections Project</a>. This
dataset was similar to the 2022 Vote Turnout dataset so an identical
cleaning process was conducted.</p>

<p>The two datasets were then merged by the <code>state_abv</code>
variable. New variables were created that were the difference in values
between 2022 and 2018 so that we could see how values changed between
the two elections. These variables are
<code>turnout_estimate_difference</code>,
<code>turnout_Rate_difference</code>,
<code>voting_eligible_difference</code>, and
<code>voting_age_difference</code>. In the merge, there ended up being
two State variables: <code>state.x</code> and <code>state.y</code>. One
of the variables were removed and the other one was renamed to
<code>state</code>.</p>

from the .csv file. The Voting Turnout datastet was imported into R from
the .csv file and the United States row was removed because none of the
other datasets had an equivalent row. The Distance to an Abortion Clinic
dataset was imported and the <code>origin_state</code> variable was
renamed to <code>state_abv</code> to match the other two datasets since
this was the variable that would be used to join the three datasets.</p>
<p>The Abortion Bans and Voting Turnout datasets were merged first by
the <code>state_abv</code> variable that existed in both datasets. In
the merge, there ended up being two State variables:
<code>state.x</code> and <code>state.y</code>. One of the variables were
removed and the other one was renamed to <code>state</code>. This
combined dataset was then combined with the Distance to an Aborion
Clinic dataset by the <code>state_abv</code> variable that existed in
both datasets. The <code>jun</code> variable was renamed to
<code>clinicdistance_jun</code> and the <code>jul</code> variable was
renamed to <code>clinicdistance_jul</code> to clarify what these
variables were.</p>

<p>This figure from the Balletopedia dataset depicts state abortion
restrictions based on the stage of pregnancy as of November 25, 2022. 44
states restricted abortions after a certain point in pregnancy, and 6
states including Washington D.C. did not implement any abortion
restrictions. There are different thresholds on when abortion is
restricted in the 44 states.</p>
<p>The definitions of the thresholds are explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conception: prohibits all abortions, but abortion may be considered
if the patient’s life is at risk.</li>
<li>Fetal heartbeat: prohibits abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be
detected; this may begin as soon as 6 weeks after the last menstrual
period. Fetal viability: prohibits abortions and is interpreted by the
Supreme Court at about 24-28 weeks into pregnancy.</li>
<li>Last menstrual period: marks the beginning of a pregnancy from the
first day of a woman’s last menstrual period (LMP).</li>
<li>Post-fertilization: marks the beginning of conception, which can be
up to 24 hours following intercourse.</li>
<li>Post-implantation: marks the beginning of pregnancy and takes place
when an egg attaches to the uterus; this is roughly five days after the
egg is fertilized.</li>
</ul>

<div id="regression-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Regression Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>A variable, <code>ab_change</code> was created to quantify the change
in abortion restriction status per state (<code>ab_change</code> = 1 if
Roe v. Wade added an abortion restriction that was not previously in
place; <code>ab_change</code> = 0 if the overturning of Roe v. Wade did
not change abortion restrictions). This variable was created by taking
the difference between abortion restriction status in 2022 and 2018.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>final_full = 
  read_csv(&quot;data_cleaned/finalprojectfinaldataset.csv&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    ab_change = abstatus22 - abstatus18
  )</code></pre>
<p>A regression model was created utilizing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outcome: The difference in percent turnout rate between 2018 and
2022 (<code>turnout_rate_difference</code>)</li>
<li>Predictor: The difference in abortion restriction status by state
between 2018 and 2022 (<code>ab_change</code>)</li>
<li>Predictor: The average difference in closest abortion clinic by
state between 2018 and 2022 (<code>dist_change</code>)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>regress_turnoutdif_full = 
  lm(turnout_rate_difference ~ ab_change + dist_change, data = final_full)

summary(regress_turnoutdif_full) 
confint(regress_turnoutdif_full)</code></pre>
<p>Upon running the model, we find that the change in abortion status
has a significant effect on voter turnout (P = 0.0261). On average, a
state that had an abortion restriction put in place after the
overturning of Roe v. Wade had a 5.661% greater voter turnout in the
2022 election compared to the 2018 election. We are 95% confident that
the true increase in voter turnout falls between 0.703% and 10.619%.</p>
<p>The average change in distance to abortion clinic was not
significant.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Discussion</strong></h2>
<p>The first set of questions we were interested in answering focused on
abortion laws and accessibility. Unfortunately, as expected, we did see
an increase in the average distance to a safe abortion provider in
states such as Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma. These are states that
have already had strict laws regarding abortion prior to the overturn of
Roe v. Wade. With the overturn, accessibility to safe abortions has only
become more inaccessible especially in Texas. In figure 5 we can see
that the average distance to an Abortion Clinic dramatically increases
from an average of ~140 miles to ~ 300 miles.</p>
<p>When assessing the voter turnout data, it was surprising to see that
in most states, voter turnout was either the same in 2018 and 2022 or
there was a lower voter turnout in 2022. This was interesting to note as
the eligible population (figure 3) stayed the same in most states, with
2022 actually having a higher eligible population in 2022.</p>
<p>When looking at the relationship between abortion laws and abortion
clinic accessibility and voter turnout, we see that change in abortion
restrictions from 2018 to 2022 had a significant impact on voter turnout
from the 2018 to 2022 election. Further research may find other datasets
which take into account other confounding variables which may also have
increased voter turnout. From these analyses we can come to a reasonable
conclusion that the overturn of Roe v Wade had some influence on voter
turnout in the midterm elections of 2022.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Limitations</strong></h2>
<p>The abortion laws datasets had a lot of missing data for the years
2019-2021 which limited our analysis to the years 2018 and 2022. This
was not a major issue since we used voter turnout data on the same years
for different reasons. Additionally, did not use the data on threshold
for abortion restrictions (the week of gestation in which abortion is
banned) in our models due to time restrictions and coding challenges.
Some states had not fully finished counting their votes by the time the
2022 voting data was compiled so these are preliminary numbers though
they were close to full count. Based on that we don’t expect a major
change in our finding using the complete count data for the
analysis.</p>
<p>Our models had other limitations. First, the predictor for abortion
restrictions in 2022 only takes into account restrictions that had an
immediate effect after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The predictor did
not take into account any state laws that were pending, up for
referendum, or to be put into effect months after the overturning.
Second, the models do not capture the nuances of abortion restrictions
whether as a result of excluding the restriction threshold from the data
or when abortion is allowed in cases of rape, incest, or harm to the
mother’s life. Including these nuances would paint a more accurate
picture of voter turnout based on each states’ exact situation. In
connection to both these limitations, a more robust model could be
created by utilizing a dataset with each states’ type of abortion
restrictions, as well as whether a referendum for abortion access was
included on a state’s ballot. Further predictors could be added, such as
state political leaning in last presidential election, religious
ideology, and other proxies for abortion access other than distance to
clinic.</p>
